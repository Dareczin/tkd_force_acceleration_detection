# Force and Acceleration Detection in Physical Activities

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook titled "Force and Acceleration Detection" focused on analyzing and visualizing force and acceleration data in physical activities. It is particularly useful for sports scientists, physiotherapists, and fitness enthusiasts interested in understanding the dynamics of physical movements.

## Features
- **Data Import and Preprocessing:** The notebook begins with importing necessary libraries and datasets. It includes preprocessing steps to prepare the data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis:** The core of the notebook involves analyzing force and acceleration data. It includes calculations of key metrics like Ground Reaction Force (GRF), acceleration of different body parts (foot, shank, thigh), and peak detection in force-time series data.
- **Visualization:** The notebook provides detailed visualizations of the analyzed data, including time-series plots and peak detection graphs. These visualizations help in understanding the patterns and anomalies in the physical movements.
